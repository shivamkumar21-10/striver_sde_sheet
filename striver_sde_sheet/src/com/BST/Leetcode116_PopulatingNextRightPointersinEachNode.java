	ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
	   - This problem involves connecting the next pointer of nodes in a **perfect binary tree**.
	   - The goal is to ensure that all nodes at the same level are connected using the 'next' pointer.
	   - Since it's a perfect binary tree, each parent has exactly **two children**.
	   - We will traverse level by level and establish connections iteratively.

	ðŸ”¹ Observations:
	   - Each level of the tree forms a **linked list** due to the 'next' pointers.
	   - If we traverse level-wise, we can easily connect:
	     - **Left child â†’ Right child (within the same parent)**
	     - **Right child â†’ Left child of the next parent** (bridging between adjacent parents)

	ðŸ”¹ Dry Run:
	   Consider the following perfect binary tree:
	   
	       1
	      / \
	     2   3
	    / \  / \
	   4   5 6  7

	   1st iteration (root level): 
	   - No connections needed, as there's only one node.

	   2nd iteration (level 2):
	   - `2.next = 3`

	   3rd iteration (level 3):
	   - `4.next = 5`
	   - `5.next = 6`
	   - `6.next = 7`

	   The modified tree with next pointers:
	   
	       1 -> null
	      / \
	     2 -> 3 -> null
	    / \  / \
	   4â†’ 5â†’6 â†’ 7 -> null

	   All nodes at the same level are now connected!

	ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:
	   - **Time Complexity:** O(N), since we visit each node once.
	   - **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use constant extra space (no extra DS like queues).

	ðŸ”¹ **Intuition:**
	   - We need to connect the next pointers in a **perfect binary tree**.
	   - Since it is a perfect tree, each parent has exactly **two children**.
	   - Using recursion, we can establish the `next` pointers in a **top-down** manner.

	ðŸ”¹ **Observations:**
	   - Every node at a given level should be connected to its next **sibling node**.
	   - If a node has a left child, it should point to the right child of the same parent.
	   - If a node has a right child, it should point to the **left child of the adjacent parent**.

	ðŸ”¹ **How the recursive function works:**
	   - **Step 1:** If the root is `null`, return.
	   - **Step 2:** If `root.left` exists, set `root.left.next = root.right`.
	   - **Step 3:** If `root.right` exists and the current node (`root`) has a `next` pointer, 
	     connect `root.right` to `root.next.left`.
	   - **Step 4:** Recursively process the left and right children.

	ðŸ”¹ **Dry Run Example:**
	   Consider the following **perfect binary tree**:

	       1
	      / \
	     2   3
	    / \  / \
	   4   5 6  7

	1. **First recursive call (root = 1)**:
	   - `2.next = 3`
	   - `connect(2)`, `connect(3)`

	2. **Second recursive call (root = 2)**:
	   - `4.next = 5`
	   - `5.next = 6` (because `2.next = 3`, so `2.right.next = 3.left`)
	   - `connect(4)`, `connect(5)`

	3. **Second recursive call (root = 3)**:
	   - `6.next = 7`
	   - `connect(6)`, `connect(7)`

	The final tree with **next pointers**:

	       1 -> null
	      / \
	     2 -> 3 -> null
	    / \  / \
	   4â†’ 5â†’6 â†’ 7 -> null

	ðŸ”¹ **Complexity Analysis:**
	   - **Time Complexity:** O(N), since we visit each node once.
	   - **Space Complexity:** O(H) = O(log N) (due to recursive stack calls).
	     - Here, `H` is the height of the tree, which is `log N` in a perfect binary tree.

	âœ… **Key Takeaways:**
	   - This solution follows a **preorder traversal** (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right).
	   - It efficiently establishes the `next` pointers in **one pass** without using extra space.
	   - Recursion ensures we process the tree in a **top-down manner**.
